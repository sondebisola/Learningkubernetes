Container Runntimes:You need to install a container runtime into each node in the cluster so that Pods can run there.

      CRI-O
      Docker Engine
      Mirantis Container Runtime


The Linux kernel does not allow IPv4 packets to be routed between interfaces
sysctl parameters, which are kernel parameters that can be modified at runtime, can be used to fine-tune network behavior and other system aspects within containers.
The parameters cover various subsystems such as:  "sudo sysctl -a"
      kernel (common prefix: kernel.)
      networking (common prefix: net.)
      virtual memory (common prefix: vm.)
      MDADM (common prefix: dev.)
      More subsystems are described in Kernel docs.
Sysctls with no namespace are called node-level sysctls
 consider nodes with special sysctl settings as tainted within a cluster.

ENABLLE IPV4 packet forwarding using sysctl
      # sysctl params required by setup, params persist across reboots
      cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
      net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
      EOF
      
      # Apply sysctl params without reboot
      sudo sysctl --system

cgroup: cgroupfs , sysytemd
control groups are used to constrain resources that are allocated to processes.

Both the kubelet and the underlying container runtime need to interface with control groups to enforce resource management for pods and containers.
and set resources such as cpu/memory requests and limits. To interface with control groups, the kubelet and the container runtime need to use the same cgroup driver and are configured the same.
      apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
      kind: KubeletConfiguration
      ...
      cgroupDriver: systemd

CERTIFICATES Management:Kubernetes requires PKI certificates for authentication over TLS.
kubeadm automatically generates certs if used for implementation.
